# Pixels-to-letters

pictures have to be 200*200 or otherwise you wonÂ´t see anything because they do not fit in the terminal but if you still want to try to use pics with a higher resolution then
ajust the values in the x and y for loop

This python code calculates the and brightness of every pixel on a given image and turns it into a letter and prints these letters in the terminal
